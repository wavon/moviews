            </ul>
            <p class="movie-review"><i>Belle</i> is inspired by the true story of Dido Elizabeth Belle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), the illegitimate mixed-race daughter of Admiral Sir John Lindsay (Matthew Goode). Raised by her aristocratic great-uncle Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) and his wife (Emily Watson), Dido's lineage affords her certain privileges, yet her status prevents her from the traditions of noble social standing.</p>
            <p class="spoiler-paragraph">Dido finds true love. Her fortuneless cousin Elizabeth finally gets married. The justice finds in favor of the insurance company, setting the stage for the abolishment of slavery. It's a fictionalized drama based on an unusual portrait painting.</p>

              <li class="rating"></li>
              <li class="genre">Family</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="movie-review">The Disney movie <i>Frozen</i>, despite appearing to be a normal-enough princesses-and-adventures offering from the mouse, has resulted in a pitched controversy among parents online. Anna, the too-trusting heroine, misses adult guidance. Instead of the prince's true love &mdash; which is often portrayed in Disney movies as forming before the heroine says a word &mdash; saving the princess, it is a sister's love that must save the day.</p>
            <p class="spoiler-paragraph">The parents die too young. Anna has to find true love to undo the spell. The love turns out to be for her sister, not the prince, who is only after her inheritance.</p>

          <h1 class="movie-title">The Zero Theorem</h1>
            <ul class="movie-info">
              <li class="year">2014</li>
              <li class="rating"></li>
              <li class="genre">Sci-Fi</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="movie-review">For fans of director Terry Gilliam and <i>Brazil</i>, <i>The Zero Theorem</i> looks like a welcome return to that movie's brand of surreal sci-fi satire. Once again there is a man stuck in a dystopian bureaucratic nightmare, buried under absurd work. Despite an impressive cast, the story goes nowhere, and the effects, sets and costumes are astonishingly low-rent. The movie's sole living female character plays the hooker with a heart of gold trope, so let's just say that this film spectacularly fails the Bechdel test.</p>
            <p class="spoiler-paragraph">The theorem Qohen searches for amounts to a mathematical proof that everything in the universe adds up to nothing.</p>
