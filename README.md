Movie reviews app

The logo should link to the home page. The logo is animated to play off the contraction of movie + reviews into "Moviews."

Create a hidden form for input. The form is displayed by clicking a "New" button.

For each new movie, the form inputs a movie title, year, rating, genre, description, and spoilers.

New reviews should be displayed at the top of the list.

There should be four genres represented. Movie reviews are filtered by genre by clicking a button. 

There is an option to include a button for all genres.

Each movie includes spoiler text that may be hidden or shown.

There is a main navigation to access other pages in the site. The link of current page must be highlighted.

Responsive design is optional.

A Wireframe and Style Guide are included in resources.
